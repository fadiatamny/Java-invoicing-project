# Java-invoicing-project

the java files are under javaProject folder.
the backend folder is the dummy api we are interfacing with.

## NOTES 

The code sometimes runs a bit slow because of the backend api so please dont worry about seeing no screen and wait a few seconds and it will show.

## HOW TO RUN :

`java -cp ./bin/program.jar View.View`
